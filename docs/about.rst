For work, I thought about introducing integration testing.
We are working with `Odoo <https://github.com/odoo/odoo>`_  and I wanted to test if e-mails created by Odoo really were sent.
I remembered `mailhog <https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog>`_, which I discovered to be abandoned.
Searching for an alternative, I found Mailpit - for which I decided to write an API-client in my free time.
